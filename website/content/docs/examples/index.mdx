import { Code, FolderOpen, Rocket } from 'lucide-react';

Welcome to the Examples section! Here you'll find complete, runnable projects built with the Better Notion SDK.

## Overview

<Code /> Each example is a complete application that demonstrates:

- Real-world use cases
- Complete code (copy-paste ready)
- Best practices and patterns
- Error handling and edge cases

## Available Examples

## Prerequisites

Before running examples, ensure you have:

- Completed [Quick Start](../quickstart)
- Set up authentication ([Authentication](../getting-started/authentication))
- Understand [Basic Concepts](../getting-started/basic-concepts)
- Created a Notion integration with database access

## Running Examples

### 1. Clone or Copy

Copy the example code into a file (e.g., `task_manager.py`).

### 2. Configure Environment

Create `.env`:
```bash
NOTION_TOKEN=secret_your_token_here
DATABASE_ID=your_database_id
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install better-notion python-dotenv
```

### 4. Run

```bash
python task_manager.py
```

## Example Structure

Each example follows this structure:

```python
import asyncio
import os
from better_notion import NotionAPI
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment
load_dotenv()

async def main():
    """Main application."""
    async with NotionAPI(auth=os.getenv("NOTION_TOKEN")) as api:
        # Application logic here
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Learning Path

We recommend following examples in order:

1. **Task Manager** - Learn CRUD operations
2. **Knowledge Base** - Learn content manipulation
3. **Automation** - Learn workflows
4. **Migration** - Learn bulk operations

## Common Patterns

### Error Handling

All examples include proper error handling:

```python
from better_notion._api.errors import NotFoundError

try:
    page = await api.pages.get(page_id)
except NotFoundError:
    print("Page not found")
```

### Async Context Manager

Resources are cleaned up automatically:

```python
async with NotionAPI(auth=token) as api:
    # API calls
    pass
# Connection closed automatically
```

### Property Builders

Type-safe property construction:

```python
from better_notion._api.properties import Title, Select

properties = {
    **Title("Task Name").build(),
    **Select("Status", "To Do").build()
}
```

## Adapting Examples

Each example can be adapted to your needs:

- **Change properties** - Modify property builders
- **Add features** - Extend with additional operations
- **Integrate** - Add to existing applications
- **Scale** - Handle larger datasets

## Next Steps

- [Task Manager Example](task-manager) - Complete CLI application
- [Knowledge Base Example](knowledge-base) - Content management
- [Automation Scripts Example](automation) - Workflow automation
- [Migration Example](migration) - Data migration
