Welcome to the **Better Notion SDK** documentation - a Python library that makes working with the Notion API simple, type-safe, and enjoyable.

<Callout type="success">
  **Version 0.2.0 (Beta)** is now available! See the [changelog](meta/changelog) for what's new.
</Callout>

## What is Better Notion?

Better Notion is a high-level Python SDK that provides:

- **Object-Oriented**: Work with entities (Pages, Blocks, Databases) not raw JSON
- **Type-Safe**: Property builders for compile-time safety
- **Paginated**: Automatic cursor-based pagination over large datasets
- **Async-First**: Built with `asyncio` and `httpx` for performance
- **Powerful**: Full access to Notion's search, queries, and operations

## Quick Example

```python
import asyncio
from better_notion import NotionAPI
from better_notion._api.properties import Title, Select

async def main():
    async with NotionAPI(auth="secret_...") as api:
        # Get a page
        page = await api.pages.get("page_id")

        # Update properties
        await page.update(
            **Select("Status", "Done").build()
        )

        # Save to Notion
        await page.save()

asyncio.run(main())
```
